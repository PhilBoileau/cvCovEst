# Summary

# Statement of Need

When the number of observations in a dataset far exceeds the number of
features, the estimator of choice for the covariance matrix is the sample
covariance matrix. It is efficient under minimal regularity assumptions on the
data-generating distribution. In high-dimensional regimes, however, its
performance is unsatisfactory: The sample covariance matrix is highly variable,
and produces estimates with diverging condition numbers and over-dispersed
eigenvalues. These issues amplify estimation error in resulting estimates. 

As high-dimensional data have become widespread, researchers have derived many
novel covariance matrix estimators to remediate the sample covariance matrix's
deficiencies. These estimators come in many flavours, though most are
constructed by regularizing the sample covariance matrix.

This variety brings with it many challenges. Identifying an "optimal" estimator
from among a collection of candidates can prove a daunting task, one whose
objectivity is often compromised by the analyst's decisions. Though data-driven
approaches for selecting an optimal estimator from among estimators belonging to
certain (limited) classes have been derived, the question of selecting from a
diverse collection of candidates remains unaddressed.

# `cvCovEst` Framework

Our response is a general, cross-validation-based framework for covariance
matrix estimator selection capable of accomplishing just that. The asymptotic
optimality of selections are guaranteed by extending the seminal work of
@laan_dudoit:2003, @dudoit2005, and @vaart2006 on data-adaptive estimator
selection to high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation [@boileau2021].

The `cvCovEst` software package implements this framework for the `R` language
and environment for statistical computing [@R]. Included is an accumulation of
covariance matrix estimators spanning the work of many researchers (Table 1)
They may be employed independently of the cross-validation procedure.
`cvCovEst` also provides a slew of plotting and summary functions. These
diagnostic tools allow users to gauge the algorithm's performance, diagnose
issues that might arise during estimation procedures, and build intuition about
the many estimators' behaviours. Given that the package was designed with
high-dimensional datasets in mind, users have options to increase the
cross-validation method's computational efficiency via parallel computation.
Parallelization relies on the suite of `future` packages [@future] by way of
the `origami` package [@origami].
