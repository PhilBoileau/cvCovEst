## Description

`cvCovEst` implements an efficient cross-validated approach to
covariance matrix estimation in high-dimensional settings. This
procedure data-adaptively identifies the optimal estimator of the
covariance matrix from a set of candidates. Dignostic tools are also
provided.

-----

## Installation

The `cvCovEst` package can installed from GitHub via `remotes`:

    remotes::install_github("PhilBoileau/scPCA")
