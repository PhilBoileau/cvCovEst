# Background and Motivation

When the number of observations in a dataset far exceeds the number of features,
the estimator of choice for the covariance matrix is the sample covariance
matrix: it is an efficient estimator under minimal regularity assumptions on the
data generating distribution. In high-dimensional regimes, however, it leaves
much to be desired. In this setting, the sample covariance matrix is either
singular, numerically unstable, or both, thereby amplifying estimation error.

As high-dimensional data became increasingly widespread, researchers derived
many novel covariance matrix estimators to remediate the sample covariance
matrixâ€™s deficiencies. These estimators come in many flavours, though most
are constructed by regularizing the sample covariance matrix, or estimating
latent factors. A comprehensive review is provided by [@fan:2016].

This variety brings challenges, however. Identifying an "optimal" estimator
from among a collection of candidates is a non-trivial task.
Though data-driven approaches for selecting the optimal estimator from within
certain classes have been derived, the question of selecting an
estimator from among a diverse collection of candidates remains unaddressed.

We therefore offer just that: a general, cross-validation-based framework for
covariance matrix estimator selection in high dimensions. This is accomplished
by adapting the seminal work of @laan-dudoit:2003, @dudoit2005, and @dudoit2006
on data-adaptive estimator selection to high-dimensional covariance matrix
estimation [@boileau2021]. The interested reader is invited to review
theoretical underpinnings of the method provided in @boileau2021.
